# Reverse Engineered Documentation for NASDAQ REST APIs

I haven't found any other documentation online, and have found this api by backtracking through other site's resources.

If you know of any other documentation, or have anything to add, please let me know! (this is far from complete)


endpoint urls:

```api.nasdaq.com/api```

```www.nasdaq.com/api/v1```


## api.nasdaq.com/api

1. ```/quote/{1}/{chart|historical|info|summary}``` where {1} is the symbol followed by the data to return  
    **Additional Parameters:**  
    ```?assetclass={mutualfunds|stocks}``` (**required for all**)  
    ```&fromdate={yyyy-mm-dd}``` (**required for historical**)  
    ```&todate={yyyy-mm-dd}``` (optional for historical)  
    ```&offset={#}``` (optional for historical)
    I believe there are other parameters that would allow seeing more data in historical, this setup returns a max of 14 days worth. There also seems to be an issue that if todate is specified and is more than one month ago from today, and the difference between todate and fromdate is less than one month, then nothing will be returned. This could potentially be worked around using offset.

2. ```/company/{1}/{company-profile|financials}``` where {1} is the symbol  
    **Additional Parameters:**  
    ```?frequency={2}``` where {2} is 1 for period endings, and 2 for quarterly endings (optional for financials)

3. ```/market-info```

4. ```/calendar/{dividends|earnings|splits|upcoming}```


## ww<span>w.</span>nasdaq.com/api/v1

5. ```/historical/{1}/{2}/{3}/{4}``` where {1} is the symbol, {2} is the assetclass, and {3} and {4} are the start and end dates in yyyy-mm-dd format. **Returns a csv document.** (this may have the same issue as the other historical data request)

6. ```/quote-news/{1}/{2}``` where I don't know what {1} is, and {2} is number of headlines per request

info = json.loads(requests.get(infourl,headers={'user-agent':"-"},timeout=5).text)

print("{} INFO:".format(symb))
print(json.dumps(info, indent=2))

print("\nSTOCK NEWS:")
print(json.dumps(news, indent=2))
